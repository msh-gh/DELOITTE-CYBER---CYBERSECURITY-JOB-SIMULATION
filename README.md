Deloitte Australia Cyber Job Simulation on Forage - June 2025
-------------------------------------------------------------------
•	Completed a job simulation involving reading web activity logs
•	Supported a client in a cyber security breach
•	Answered questions to identify suspicious user activity

By completing this task, I learned how to read web log files, and how to identify spot suspicious requests. It turns out. For a little bit of context, the dashboard lives in Daikibo's Intranet. The only remote access to it would be through VPN tunneling. After navigating through the web log file, I noticed that the request of the user with the IP address of 192.168.0.101 starts off with a regular login and then browsing of the dashboard. But then it turns into a regular, once-per-hour automated check of the statuses in all 4 factories with no page resources being loaded and with obviously non-human punctuality.
